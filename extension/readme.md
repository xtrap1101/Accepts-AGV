# Auto Accept Agent

## Run 3 AI agents in parallel. Zero babysitting.

Stop watching tabs. Auto Accept keeps every conversation moving — accepting file edits, terminal commands, and recovery prompts automatically.

## Why Auto Accept?

AI-powered IDEs like Cursor and Antigravity are powerful, but they stop every time the agent needs approval.

**That's dozens of interruptions per hour.**

Auto Accept eliminates the wait:
- ✅ **File edits** — Auto-applied
- ✅ **Terminal commands** — Auto-executed
- ✅ **Retry prompts** — Auto-confirmed
- ✅ **Stuck agents** — Auto-recovered

---

## Features

### Background Mode
Run multiple tabs simultaneously. Every conversation auto-accepts in the background — no tab-switching required.

### Dangerous Command Blocking
Built-in protection against destructive commands like `rm -rf /`. Customize the blocklist to fit your workflow.

### Real-time Status Overlay
Visual indicators show conversation state:
- **Purple** — In progress, actively polling
- **Green** — Task completed

### Works Everywhere
- ✅ Cursor
- ✅ Antigravity
- ✅ Multiple windows
- ✅ Minimized/unfocused

### Cursor Support
